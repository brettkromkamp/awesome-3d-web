# Awesome 3D Web [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

![Isometric classroom](resources/brave-robot3.png)

> A curated list of amazingly awesome articles, applications, software libraries and projects related to the 3D web space. This subject is of particular interest to me within the context of several personal projects that I am working on including an interactive e-book prototype ([Codex Roboticus](https://brettkromkamp.com/posts/codex-roboticus/)) and a knowledge management application ([Contextualise](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/contextualise)).
